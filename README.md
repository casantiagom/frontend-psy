# Mental Health Questionnaire Frontend
This repository contains the frontend code for a mental health questionnaire site. The frontend is built using Next.js, and uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The site is connected to a backend built using Django and Python, which handles the storage and processing of questionnaire responses.

# Getting Started
To get started with the frontend, you'll need to follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.
Install the necessary dependencies using npm.
Start the development server to run the frontend.
Note that you'll also need to have the backend running in order for the site to function properly.

# Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the frontend:

Node.js 12 or higher
npm 6 or higher
All of the required npm packages are included in the package.json file in the repository.

# Firebase Setup
To set up Firebase authentication for the frontend, you'll need to follow these steps:

Create a new Firebase project on the Firebase console.
Set up a new authentication provider using the Google sign-in method.
Copy the Firebase project credentials and add them to the .env.local file in the repository.
Running the Frontend
To run the frontend, follow these steps:

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Run the command npm install to install the required dependencies.
Run the command npm run dev to start the development server.
The frontend should now be running on http://localhost:3000/.
